This repository is simply a test to standardize commit messages using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) & [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

### ðŸ“œ How it works?

After making your changes, just start the commit:

```bash
$ git commit
```

This will start the information gathering process for that commit.
